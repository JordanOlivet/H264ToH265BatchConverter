# H264ToH265BatchConverter

This project aim to provide some conversion functionnalities around videos encoding.
Tihis project uses ffmpeg utility to make the conversion.

Initial usage :

* Convert h264 videos to h265 in order to reduce their size.
* Conversion of selected video files
* Conversion of all video files within a folder and/or its subfolders.

To Do/Ideas :

* Improved UI with a lot of feedback, progress per file, per folder ...
* Some sort of detection of the current encodig of the input file in order to not convert it if it is already in h265 encoding.
* More customization of the process of conversion (choice of preset, more logs, convert audio etc ...)
* And many more !
